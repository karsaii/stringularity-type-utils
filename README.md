## Documentation

Less type boilerplate, more fun!

The functions available were written as needed over the course of two years
(2015-2017), and with most browsers' support in mind - not guaranteed to
properly work in IE8 or below without performance hitches or such.

## Usage

``` javascript
var stu = require('stringularity-type-utils');

stu.isString('someString');
// ...

```

## Testing

The unit tests were written using mocha, chai and coverage with istanbul, and
nyc. A lot of effort went into the exhaustive unit testing of the fundamental
functions - the basics.
